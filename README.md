## Updates

- **New Dataset Added**: A dataset called *RealNews* has been integrated into WordStream. This dataset originates from the [Fake and Real News Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset?resource=download), which has been preprocessed for improved analysis.  
- **Sentiment Analysis Tab**: A new tab for sentiment analysis has been introduced, allowing users to assess the sentiment of news articles.  
- **Test Version Available**: A test version showcasing how the new features might look has been added.  

### Sentiment Analysis Test Dataset:
In the sentiment analysis feature, the color-coding of sentiments is as follows:
- **Orange** indicates a neutral sentiment.
- **Red** indicates a negative sentiment.
- **Green** indicates a positive sentiment. 

These colors help provide a quick, intuitive way to gauge the emotional tone of news content.
